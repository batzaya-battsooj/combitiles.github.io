<h1>COMBITILES</h1>
<p>Our game is a puzzle game.
		The goal of the game is all parts must be appeared somewhere in the board.
		As you see in the video, it has 3 different modes to play.
		In "Drag Mode", you have to drag and drop all parts to the board. And if you can move all the parts and fill the board, it will be cleared.
		Draw mode and swap mode is same as Drag mode, but board filling methods are different.
		Of course, as level goes up number of parts increases and the board goes bigger.
		And it is possible to set time limit or move limit. There are other features we are planning like a locked tile, linked tiles etc.
		There are 2 kind of items "star" and "hint". star will be used unlocking packages. hint will be used to see a solution hint.</p>
